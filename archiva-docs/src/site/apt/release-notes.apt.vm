Release Notes for Archiva ${project.version}

  The Apache Archiva team would like to announce the release of Archiva
  ${project.version}.  Archiva is {{{http://archiva.apache.org/download.html}
  available for download from the web site}}.

  Archiva is an application for managing one or more remote repositories,
  including administration, artifact handling, browsing and searching.

  If you have any questions, please consult:

    * the web site: {{http://archiva.apache.org/}}

    * the archiva-user mailing list: {{http://archiva.apache.org/mail-lists.html}}

* New in Archiva ${project.version}

  This release is a bug fix release.

* Compatibility Changes

  * If upgrading from earlier versions of Archiva, the list of libraries in
    <<<wrapper.conf>>> has changed. If you have customized your copy of
    <<<wrapper.conf>>>, please update it for compatibility with the version
    distributed with the current release.

  * As the database storage has been removed, you can remove the JNDI entry
    for <<<jdbc/archiva>>>.  After upgrading from a previous version, you will
    have to run a full scan to populate the new JCR Repository. This will be
    done on first start of Archiva.

  Refer to the {{{./adminguide/upgrade.html} Upgrading Archiva guide}} for more
  information.

* History

  Archiva was started in November 2005, building a simple framework on top of some existing repository conversion
  tools within the Maven project. Initial development focused on repository conversion, error reporting, and indexing.
  From January 2006 a web application was started to visualise the information and to start incorporating
  functionality from the unmaintained maven-proxy project.

  Development continued through many stops and starts. Initial versions of Archiva were built from source by contributors,
  and the first alpha version was not released until April 2007. Some significant changes were made to improve
  performance and functionality in June 2007 and over the next 6 months and a series of alpha and beta releases, a concerted effort
  was made to release the 1.0 version.

  Archiva became an Apache "top level project" in March 2008.
